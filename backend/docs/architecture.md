# CloudScribe Architecture

## Overview
CloudScribe is built using a modular, service-oriented architecture following clean architecture principles. The application is divided into distinct layers with clear responsibilities.

## Layers

### API Layer
- Routes: Handle HTTP requests and route them to appropriate controllers
- Controllers: Handle request/response cycle and delegate business logic to services
- Validation: Input validation using Zod schemas
- Middleware: Cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, etc.

### Service Layer
- Business Logic: Core application logic
- Data Access: Interaction with database through Prisma ORM
- External Services: Email, caching, notifications, etc.

### Data Layer
- Models: Prisma schema definitions
- Migrations: Database structure version control
- Seeds: Initial data population

## Key Components

### Authentication

- Session management

### Caching

- Multiple caching strategies
- Cache invalidation patterns

### Security
- Request validation
- SQL injection protection
- XSS protection
